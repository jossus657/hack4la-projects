The Subrecipient must develop and implement training curriculum, develop a toolkit/guide, and provide technical assistance for prosecutors, criminal justice system personnel, and allied victim service providers.","Restorative justice in the form of mediation or reconciliation between offenders and victims/survivors has been utilized since the 1970s. There is not a shared understanding of how to implement a restorative justice process within the victim service(s) field, the criminal justice system, and specifically within the prosecutorial process. Restorative justice includes a broad range of activities and normally involves both the criminal justice system and non-governmental partners.  Per the United States Office of Justice Programs (OJP), restorative justice is “a process whereby parties with a stake in a specific offense resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offense and its implications for the future.” OJP further describes the process as an approach that “creates opportunities for empowerment of crime victims to identify their own needs and requirements for justice” and provides “those who have harmed an opportunity to take action to repair the harm caused by criminal behavior.”  For prosecutors, restorative justice may be seen as a tool to empower victims/survivors, seek the best justice for victims/survivors of crime, and lessen prosecutorial caseloads. Restorative justice is not appropriate for all criminal cases. The safety of the victim/survivor and the community must always be considered. Additionally, both the victim/survivor and offender must choose this process; it cannot be mandatory.  Restorative justice is most commonly used in the juvenile justice system. The RJ Program would train prosecutors, criminal justice system personnel, and allied victim service providers to use the restorative justice process safely and effectively for the prosecution of criminal cases of sexual assault and domestic violence where the victim/survivor is 11 years of age or older.
