The Subrecipient must develop and implement training curriculum, develop a toolkit/guide, and provide technical assistance for prosecutors, criminal justice system personnel, and allied victim service providers.","Restorative justice in the form of mediation or reconciliation between offenders and victims/survivors has been utilized since the 1970s. There is not a shared understanding of how to implement a restorative justice process within the victim service(s) field, the criminal justice system, and specifically within the prosecutorial process. Restorative justice includes a broad range of activities and normally involves both the criminal justice system and non-governmental partners.  Per the United States Office of Justice Programs (OJP), restorative justice is “a process whereby parties with a stake in a specific offense resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offense and its implications for the future.” OJP further describes the process as an approach that “creates opportunities for empowerment of crime victims to identify their own needs and requirements for justice” and provides “those who have harmed an opportunity to take action to repair the harm caused by criminal behavior.”  For prosecutors, restorative justice may be seen as a tool to empower victims/survivors, seek the best justice for victims/survivors of crime, and lessen prosecutorial caseloads. Restorative justice is not appropriate for all criminal cases. The safety of the victim/survivor and the community must always be considered. Additionally, both the victim/survivor and offender must choose this process; it cannot be mandatory.  Restorative justice is most commonly used in the juvenile justice system. The RJ Program would train prosecutors, criminal justice system personnel, and allied victim service providers to use the restorative justice process safely and effectively for the prosecution of criminal cases of sexual assault and domestic violence where the victim/survivor is 11 years of age or older.

In addition, victims must be allowed to choose which supportive services best fit their needs.","The VSB has several programs that address shelter needs and supportive services for victims of crime. However, traditional shelters and services aren’t always the best choice for victims with specialized needs (e.g., elderly, youth, men, disabled, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+), non-English speaking, culturally or religiously marginalized, etc.). Barriers exist that affect their ability and willingness to engage, and finding alternative shelter can be extremely challenging.  Since 2017, California has implemented the Housing First Model as defined in Welfare and Institutions (W&I) Code Section 8255 to address the prevalence of homelessness in California. The Housing First Model is an approach to connect individuals and families experiencing homelessness quickly and successfully to permanent housing without preconditions and barriers to entry, such as sobriety, treatment, or service participation requirements.In fiscal year 2021-22, W&I Code Section 8255 was amended and the language to exempt “programs that fund state shelters” was removed. Therefore, shelter programs such as the KE Program are required to adopt guidelines and regulations of the Housing First Model (see W&I Code Section 8255 for the core components of Housing First).  The purpose of the KE Program is to expand emergency shelter/emergency housing assistance and provide supportive services for victims of crime with specialized needs (e.g., elderly, youth, men, disabled, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+), non-English speaking, culturally or religiously marginalized, etc.) who cannot be served through a traditional shelter.

CDFA will make approximately $12.2 million (40% of $30.4 million) available for the AMMP, which includes an allocation for technical assistance grants under AB 2377. The Dairy Digester Research and Development Program (DDRDP) will have approximately $18.2 million available to support digesters that reduce methane emissions from dairy operations.  CDFA will fund up to 100% of the total project cost with a maximum grant award of $750,000 per project. Matching funds are strongly encouraged.  The maximum project term is two (2) years. Grant funds cannot be expended before January 1, 2023, or after December 31, 2024. CDFA may offer an award different than the amount requested.  The project site must be located on a commercial California dairy or livestock operation. Individuals receiving grant award funds must be located in California with a physical California business address. A dairy operation is defined as an entity that operates a dairy herd, which produces milk or cream commercially, and whose bulk milk or bulk cream is received or handled by any distributor, manufacturer, or any nonprofit cooperative association of dairy producers. A livestock operation is defined as an entity raising farm animals such ascattle, poultry, goats, sheep, swine, and horses. AMMP supports several project types for which there are methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. To be eligible, the current baselinemanure management practices must include the anaerobic decomposition of volatile solids stored in a lagoon or other predominantly liquid anaerobic environment. Methane is produced when volatile manure solids are stored in wet, anaerobic conditions; consequently, conditions that lead to methane production must currently exist at a dairy or livestock operation in order for methane emission reductions to be achieved through an AMMP project.  While solid separation or conversion from flush to dry scrape manure collection can be a critical component of an AMMP project, these practices are not considered to be stand-alone projects because they relate only to how manure is separated or collected. In order to calculate GHG emissions and emission reductions, it is also necessary to identify how the separated or collected manure volatile solids will be treated and/or stored (e.g., open solar drying, composting in vessel). Storage or further treatment will always take place with separated orcollected solids, and applicants are required to identify what this will be. The storage or further treatment of the collected solids produces methane to varying degrees, as determined by the Methane Conversion Factor (MCF) for each practice. Applicants should use the definitions provided to determine which practice most closely describes how they will manage separated or scraped manure volatile solids.

Research will address integration barriers with instrumentation, software, and training related to natural gas system integrity management, as it pertains to microbially influenced and soil property influenced corrosion.","The purpose of this solicitation is to fund natural gas infrastructure safety and integrity projects that meet the following initiative: Technologies to Inspect and Prevent Corrosion of Natural Gas Pipelines and Storage Facilities.   This solicitation will address needed improvements in the instruments for detecting corrosion, modeling software for predicting corrosion, and training related to utility integrity management programs with a focus on mitigating risks and damages caused by corrosion. This development requires improved instruments to measure physical parameters (e.g., soil resistivity, voltages across metal surfaces, or wall thickness) and deeper understanding of the mechanisms of different types of corrosion. Complementary to the instruments is modeling software which can use the data obtained by the instruments to project corrosion growth rates and probability of potential leakages and recommend mitigation strategies. Modeling software needs to improve its accuracy and support decision making for maintenance and operation by incorporating variables and data points commensurate with a deepening understanding of corrosion mechanisms.  Projects must fall within the following project groups:  ·       Group 1: Technologies for Natural Gas Pipeline Corrosion Risk Management: This group will improve and integrate existing and emerging technology (TRL 6 or higher) to determine the size of corrosion pitting and cracks on both the internal and external surfaces of the pipelines and develop a toolkit to evaluate and mitigate the risks of corrosion damage to natural gas pipelines.  ·       Group 2: Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion Control: MIC is caused by the presence of microorganisms that contribute to rapid degradation of metals and alloys. This group will conduct research to increase the understanding of MIC, and develop a testing kit for MIC detection and a treatment to inhibit or prevent MIC.

Systems that enable the use of energy stored in PEV batteries to power loads inside residential, commercial, or public buildings—referred to as vehicle-to-building (V2B) technologies—can provide resilience and reliability benefits that help mitigate the impacts of power outages driven by extreme heat events, wildfires, and public safety power shutoffs. PEVs contain large batteries that could potentially provide the same backup power services as behind the meter stationary storage at a lower cost than purchasing a dedicated storage system and without the emissions associated with diesel backup generators.    This solicitation seeks to accelerate development of technologies and easy-to-implement products that allow individual or fleets of PEVs to power residential, commercial, or public buildings including but not limited to schools, community centers, or government facilities during electricity outages or intentional islanding events.

When Californians lack transportation, live far from their library, or work long hours, mobile libraries and expanded program delivery make it possible to access library services and programs.  All participating libraries will:  Acquire a new or modify an existing bookmobile or community outreach vehicle, or provide programs intended to improve library access and program delivery Have a partner or community connection with at least one organization Provide brief quarterly reports on status of bookmobiles or community outreach vehicles  An applicant must be a California public library, or a California cooperative system, consortium or library membership organization. Cooperatives, consortia or library organizations must apply on behalf of a specific, defined group of affiliate libraries.  Most awards will be from $50,000 to $250,000, though we may consider smaller or larger amounts (for example, in the case of a cooperative application) on a case-by-case basis.  A match is required for these grants, which may be cash, in-kind, or a combination of both. The match will be based on your library's Local Income Per Capita (LIPC) level, which is derived from California Public Libraries Survey data. For libraries in LIPC Level 1, a 20% match will be required. For LIPC Level 2, a 25% match will be required. For LIPC Level 3, a 30% match will be required. The match is a percentage of funds requested, not a percentage of the total budget. For example, the 20% match on a $100,000 funding request would be $20,000. We will consider reductions in match on a limited, case-by-case basis.  Each funded project must have at least one partner or community connection. A partner is defined as an organization with which your library has a written agreement and which also provides resources to the project, either cash or in-kind, or both. A community connection is defined as an organization that supports your project but with whom you have no formal written agreement.  We are seeking projects that are guided by the principles of equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging in all aspects of project planning, implementation, and evaluation.  Funded projects can include the purchase of vehicles, such as bookmobiles, vans, bikes, or other vehicles, to extend library services to hard-to-reach populations. Projects involving vehicles that use alternative fuels, such as electric vehicles, are especially encouraged. Proposals for program support for existing vehicles that are underutilized because of lack of staff and other resources such as collections and equipment will also be considered.  Projects may also include proposals to support programs intended to improve library access and program delivery, including lockers and pop-up libraries.

The Resilience Planning and Public Services Program funds jurisdictions/entities, to create projects that address risks to, or across, community lifelines that support human health and safety and provide mitigation for individual and community-based systems.","The intent of this NOFA is to fund actionable, impaction planning and public services projects that have measurable results in risk reduction from natural hazards. Planning projects funded under this program may be tied to implementation efforts either within the related MIT-Resilience Infrastructure Program or other projects to reduce risk and increase resilience. If a project is not tied directly to implementation, the focus of the planning project should be actionable, measurable and able to be utilized by jurisdictions immediately.    Eligible activities considered under this program include the creation or updating of current plans for better alignment with mitigation principles or, in some cases, examining hazards and establishing actions to increase resilience and preparedness. Entities may also use the funding to increase public services through establishing educational campaigns or local job training initiatives to ensure disaster preparedness is a vital component of their communities’ resilience efforts going forward.    Additionally, HCD considers awards for funding under this program to local jurisdictions who may be eligible for the Resilient Infrastructure Program (MIT-RIP) but need to build capacity prior to implementing projects.Eligible applicants include:    • Jurisdictions that have eligible projects and are located within the MID areas, OR• Jurisdictions within the DR-4344 and DR-4353 impacted counties that develop an eligible mitigation planning and or public services project that directly benefits the MID, OR• Non-profits with demonstrated experience in the area that develop an eligible mitigation planning and or public services project that directly benefits the MID.    Projects must benefit the area designated by HUD as the most impacted and distressed areas, or “the MID,” within the disaster declared impacted counties under DR-4344 and DR-4353.    Planning activities do not have to meet a National Objective. Public Services projects must meet one of two National Objectives, either benefit low- to moderate-income (LMI) persons or meet an urgent need mitigation,         Mitigation and resilience are best gained through collaborative approaches with multiple stakeholders. HCD will encourage coordination among eligible applicants to increase coordination across organizational and geographical boundaries and to improve project outcomes.    Planning and public services projects funded under this program should be inclusive of all residents and community stakeholders.    Additionally, given that resources do exist within the state to address planning efforts, including within HCD, additional technical assistance to applicants and coordination with other state and local partners will ensure there is no duplication of benefits.

Senate Bill 100 (De León, 2018) establishes the goal of providing 100 percent of retail electric sales in California with renewable and zero carbon electricity by 2045. Preliminary analyses suggest achieving this target could require cumulative capacity additions of grid-connected battery storage in the range of 50 GW by 2045, much of which is expected to be provided by lithium-ion batteries. Simultaneous electrification of transportation will require even larger deployment of lithium-ion batteries in plug in electric vehicles (PEVs). Executive Order N-79-20 sets targets for 100 percent of passenger vehicles and trucks sold after 2035 to be zero emission as well as transitioning medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles to zero emission wherever feasible by 2045. The combined retirements of grid-connected stationary storage and PEV batteries reaching end-of-life will create a large potential electronic waste stream that needs to be sustainably managed.    Lithium-ion batteries from stationary storage and PEVs also have significant potential value at end-of-life for reuse and eventual recycling. Recycling and introduction of recovered materials into supply chains can reduce the need for virgin materials, thereby avoiding the environmental and social impacts associated with their production. Recycled materials may also substitute as lower cost feedstocks in the fabrication of new batteries, resulting in reduced purchase costs for batteries in PEVs and stationary storage applications. Establishing recycling expertise and capability within California creates opportunities for clean energy jobs and can contribute to the state’s economic development. Motivated by these potential benefits and the need to sustainably manage projected battery waste streams, Assembly Bill 2832 (Dahle, 2018) created the Lithium-ion Car Battery Recycling Advisory Group in 2019. The interagency group is consulting with researchers and other experts in battery recycling to develop policy recommendations for the Legislature to enable reuse and recycling of as close to 100 percent as possible of PEV battery waste at end-of-life.    This solicitation builds from previous investments to fund multidisciplinary applied research and development projects with the goals of: 1) improving lithium-ion battery direct recycling processes, 2) demonstrating pathways for incorporation of recycled materials into battery manufacturing, and 3) informing scale-up and future commercialization efforts to establish direct recycling capacity in California.          ",Business; Nonprofit; Public Agency,State,Not Required,2000000.0,Reimbursement(s),2021-01-06 08:00:00,2021-03-15 17:00:00,"April 27, 2021",https://www.energy.ca.gov/,,,,,0

Outreach and education projects should include measures of impact.,"FREP invites research and education project proposals in three priority areas: Improving Input Management, Understanding Soil-Plant Processes, and Characterizing Loss Pathways.  1. IMPROVING INPUT MANAGEMENT:  A. Demonstrating and/or Validating Management Practices that Optimize Nutrient and/or Irrigation Water Use Innovative management practices must be implemented on farms to promote agriculture sustainability and address agricultural challenges in California. Extension efforts that improve management practices and help implement efficient nutrient management practices on growers’ fields are a high priority.   B. Addressing Challenges and Barriers to Adoption of Management Practices A variety of money and time-saving management practices that improve environmental outcomes, with respect to N loss, are available; however, many of these practices have not been adopted on a large scale. Research focused on addressing barriers to widespread adoption of improved management practices could include:  C. Education and Outreach (Technical Education) The implementation of optimal irrigation and nutrient management practices depends on skilled and knowledgeable growers, managers, and field staff. Technical trainings and education can increase grower and field staff knowledge leading to improvements in on-farm management practices. Development of educational and/or certification programs to improve nitrogen and irrigation management are encouraged.  2. UNDERSTANDING PLANT-SOIL PROCESSES: A. Filling Knowledge Gaps for Nitrogen Management in Specific Crops  B. The Role of Organic Input Materials in Soil Nutrient Management Across California, organic materials are applied to agricultural soils to improve physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. More information on the plant-available nitrogen from organic sources is needed for management decisions, and to help growers estimate mineralization rates for nitrogen budgeting. These organic materials include, but are not limited to, wood chips from whole orchard recycling, nitrogen-containing soil amendments, and organic fertilizers.  3. LOSS PATHWAYS:  A. Understanding Nitrogen Movement from the Root Zone  B.

By itself, California’s $3.1 trillion gross domestic product (2019 GDP) places it fifth among the world’s largest economies. For 2019, the robust and growing industrial sector accounted for 10% of California’s GDP.    To produce the varied products and commodities that California is known for requires large quantities of energy and water. Available estimates indicate on an annual basis, California’s industrial sector accounts for over 25% of the state’s electricity consumption, 35% of its natural gas use, and is responsible for over 20% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).    California is also home to one of the largest and most unique water and wastewater infrastructure systems in the nation – delivering water and treating wastewater in farms, homes, and industries. Current estimates have California’s wastewater treatment plants treating approximately 4 billion gallons per day, with an annual energy consumption over 1,700 gigawatt-hours.    Given the scale of California’s IAW sectors’ energy usage, diversity, and significant contributions to California’s economy, it is vital to find solutions to help these sectors remain competitive in the global economy while helping to meet California’s ambitious energy efficiency and decarbonization goals set forth by SB32, SB100 and SB350.    The IAW sectors have significant potential for improvements in energy and water efficiency but are difficult sectors to promote energy efficiency and to decarbonize. Each sector and the individual facilities each have unique operational needs, have a mix of old and new equipment, lack easy access to actionable operation data for decision making and lack verified performance data under real-world conditions for promising emerging technologies.

4882,closed,2022-02-28 23:42:42,CA Energy Commission,GFO-20-306 – Research Hub for Electric Technologies in Truck Applications (RHETTA),Grant,No,Energy,"The purpose is to fund applied research and development and technology demonstration and deployment activities through the creation of a Research Hub for Electric Technologies in Truck Applications. The research hub will engage stakeholders to advance high power charging systems and to plan, design, and deploy innovative corridor charging strategies that extend the range and increase the operational flexibility of battery electric trucks.","California has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improving air quality, and protecting the health of all Californians. The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in California and a major contributor to criteria pollutant emissions. Heavy-duty (HD) vehicles account for nearly 10 percent of the state’s GHG emissions and 26 percent of nitrogen oxides (NOx).To address these impacts, the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan established targets to improve freight efficiency, transition to zero-emission (ZE) technologies, and increase the competitiveness of California's freight system. Recently the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Trucks regulation established requirements for truck manufacturers to sell an increasing number of ZE trucks in California, potentially ramping-up to deploy over 300,000 ZE trucks between 2024 and 2035.    Replacing combustion-powered drayage trucks with ZE alternatives can greatly improve regional air quality, reduce health impacts on nearby communities, and reduce GHG emissions. However, drayage fleets beginning to adopt battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) face challenges related to understanding the performance and flexibility of BEV drayage trucks to meet their operational needs, and to installing necessary charging infrastructure in locations with limited physical space and electrical capacity. Although near-commercial BEV drayage trucks have sufficient range for many short haul operations with predictable return-to-base configurations, fleets may be reluctant to purchase BEVs that cannot flexibly cover all their routes. Variability in payload weight, driver behavior and conditions, and route characteristics create additional uncertainty in how fleet operators can incorporate BEV drayage trucks in real-world operations.    Battery-electric drayage trucks are only beginning to be evaluated through large-scale demonstrations and deployments. CARB and the California Energy Commission (CEC) are partnering to fund deployment of a fleet of 50 or more electric drayage trucks and installation of centralized depot charging infrastructure. Truck original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are investing heavily in commercialization of Class 8 battery electric trucks, with approximately six near-commercial products being tested today. The CARB-CEC demonstration will evaluate OEMs’ ability to produce BEV drayage trucks at high volumes and the ability of local distribution infrastructure to provide sufficient power to charge a large fleet.                    ",Business; Nonprofit; Public Agency,State,25%,23000000.0,Reimbursement(s),2020-12-17 08:00:00,2021-03-29 17:00:00,5/11/2021,https://www.energy.ca.gov/,,,,,0

The deadly and destructive fires of the past few years, as well as findings from California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, have highlighted the dire impacts expected from climate change on California if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced. To avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, California has set aggressive policy goals to decarbonize its energy sector by 2045. Building decarbonization – primarily achieved through energy efficiency, onsite renewable generation and storage, and full end-use electrification – is a key strategy for realizing the state’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A number of California’s local governments are already pursuing ordinances that would require all new and existing buildings to be zero-emission by 2030 and 2050, respectively.    Through its research and development investments, the CEC has supported the development of a number of promising technologies that can help support the feasibility of a zero-emission mixed-use development. Many of the technologies have benefits beyond their energy and emission savings that can help facilitate their market adoption. For example, advancements in solid-state lighting and heat exchangers are enabling lighting and HVAC products in novel new form factors; potentially opening a new set of design options for architects to increase the aesthetic appeal and functionality of buildings. In addition, market actors and stakeholders are pursuing promising innovations in architecture, planning, policy, technology, construction, and financing. To address both greenhouse gas emissions and rising housing costs, technology and non-technology innovations across these sectors will need to come together into new models capable of disrupting the housing sector so that all Californians have access to safe, healthy, affordable, and desirable living environments.    This solicitation will be conducted as a two-phase design-build competition. The CEC may consider adding a third-phase grand prize challenge that will be awarded to the best of the four Build Phase projects to scale their design across the state. There is currently up to $12,000,000 available for the Design Phase portion of this solicitation. There is an additional $36,000,000 in funding available for the Build Phase of this competition contingent upon approval of the CEC’s 2021-2025 EPIC Investment Plan.

It is important for applicants to be aware that SB 1380 applies to the Adult Reentry Grant Program. As such, this will require applicants proposing projects that include housing or housing-related services to people experiencing homelessness or at-risk of homelessness to incorporate the core components of Housing First in their proposed program design.  Housing First is an approach to serving people experiencing homelessness that recognizes a homeless person must first be able to access a decent, safe place to live, that does not limit length of stay (permanent housing), before stabilizing, improving health, reducing harmful behaviors, or increasing income. Under the Housing First approach, anyone experiencing homelessness is connected to a permanent home as quickly as possible and Housing First programs remove barriers to accessing housing and do not require sobriety or an absence of criminal history. It is based on the “hierarchy of need” in which people must access basic necessities like a safe place to live and food to eat before being able to achieve quality of life or pursue personal goals. Housing First values choice not only in where to live, but whether to participate in services. For this reason, tenants are not required to participate in services to access or retain housing.  The statutory language authorizing the Adult Reentry Grant Program does not specify the types of Warm Handoff reentry services to be funded. Applicants should select programs that best fit the needs of the community.

Many of these children are nonverbal or otherwise unable to communicate if abused. The abuse and neglect rate for children with disabilities is higher due to their vulnerability and decreased likelihood that the perpetrator will be identified and prosecuted.    Currently, California has no legislative mandate for cameras on school transportation used by students with disabilities/special needs. Although some districts have independently implemented cameras, the cost of camera equipment and monitoring is a huge barrier and prohibits districts or local/county education agencies from moving forward.
