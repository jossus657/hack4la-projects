# hack4la-projects

Portfolio of projects taken on by working for Hack for LA. As a member of the Data Science Community of Practice Team at Hack for LA, data science and analysis projects are taken on through a lens of community improvement and service. Code and datasets will be organized based on their respective project.



## **Project Descriptions:**


**California Grants:**
The California Grants Project revolves around a public dataset from the ca.gov public data portal. Due to the The Grant Information Act of 2018, the State Library was required to build a website by July 1, 2020, “that provides a centralized location … to find state grant opportunities.” All agencies were then required to post this information onto grants.ca.gov for the State Library. This data includes how to apply, links for more details, total amount given, etc. and is regularly updated and included was a dictionary for the variables. This project is an EDA that aims to efficiently and meaningfully explore the data in order to gain insights for a potential future project or implementation of this data. Findings and analyses were presented to the team for further action and review.




**Labels Survey Analysis:**
The Hack4La Github repository has seen the usage of many labels in order to categorize the various tasks and projects taken on by our organization. Through years of projects and their labels we have found that our labels lack a clear and standard structure and that  it would be much more convenient for our future endeavors if we had a standardized system of labels for our assignments. Thus the Data Science Community of Practice has taken on a project in order to analyze the current labels used in our system and give our recommendation for what should be standard practice moving forward. Recommendations and analyses were presented as a proposal to the Dev-Ops division for further implementation.
